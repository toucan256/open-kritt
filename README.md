# open·kritt

**Orchestrate AI agents to find real vulnerabilities in code.**

An open-source, self-hosted security and vulnerability research platform that turns
focused AI analysis into de-duplicated, ranked findings with configurable validation and
enrichment.

## What is open·kritt?

Pointing a model at an entire repository and asking it to find vulnerabilities rarely
works well. open·kritt takes a focused approach: break the research into small,
well-defined tasks, run them across AI agents in parallel, and combine their output into
findings you can validate and prioritize.

It is built for security researchers and security-minded developers who want control
over their prompts, workflows, model providers, and infrastructure.

### What it does

- **Build workflows** — chain focused prompts into reusable security research playbooks.
- **Run scans** — analyze remote or local repositories and their dependencies with Codex
  or Claude Code.
- **Verify findings** — use post-scripts to validate issues, build proofs of concept, and
  produce reports.
- **Export scan results** — package canonical findings, structured data, post-processing
  output, reports, and proofs of concept in one ZIP archive with a share-safe manifest;
  completed scans produce complete exports, while stopped or failed scans with findings
  produce clearly marked partial exports. Attacker-influenced report and PoC source is
  kept as plain text.
- **Prioritize results** — apply custom severity rankers, a consistent finding schema,
  and automatic de-duplication.
- **Bring your own model access** — use a Codex login or connect through OpenAI,
  Anthropic, OpenRouter, xAI, or Z.ai.

## Getting started

You need Git, Docker with Docker Compose, and Node.js 20 or newer. The repository-local
CLI has no install step.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kritt-ai/open-kritt
cd open-kritt
./kritt setup
./kritt start
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) once the stack is running. You only
need one model-access option; `./kritt setup` guides you through the available logins and
API keys. A `GITHUB_TOKEN` is optional and only needed for private GitHub repositories.

On a server without a browser or desktop, leave the stack running and open another shell:

```bash
./kritt-headless
```

The headless CLI imports portable workflow, post-script, skill, and ranker JSON; creates
scans with the same backend validation as the web form; displays scan status, stages, and
failure reasons; edits non-secret runtime settings; and exports finding bundles. It does
not display finding contents in the terminal. See the
[headless CLI guide](docs-site/getting-started/headless-cli.mdx).

The default ports bind to `127.0.0.1`, and the backend does not include application
authentication. Keep the stack private.

Tool-enabled agents run as root inside disposable job containers, with writable repository
copies and direct internet access so they can install tools, compile targets, run tests,
and build proofs of concept. Run open·kritt on a dedicated Docker host or VM; see the
[threat model](docs/threat-model.md) before scanning untrusted code.

For prerequisites, manual Docker setup, and provider-specific instructions, read the
[installation guide](docs-site/getting-started/installation-and-setup.mdx) and
[AI provider setup](docs-site/ai-provider-setup/overview.mdx).
